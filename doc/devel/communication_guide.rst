Content guidelines
====================
Communication on official channels, such as the Matplotlib homepage or on
Matplotlib social accounts, should conform to the following standards:

- be primarily about Matplotlib, 3rd party packages, and visualizations made with Matplotlib
- also acceptable topics: Python, Visualization, NumFOCUS libraries
- no gratuitous disparaging of other visualization libraries and tools; criticism is acceptable so long as it serves a constructive purpose
- follow visualization communication best practices
    - don't share non-expert visualizations when it could be harmful
      - put on meeting agenda when answer isn't clearly to hold off on sharing.
    - clearly state when the visualization data/conclusions cannot be verified
      - do not rely on machine translations for sensitive visualizations
    - example: https://twitter.com/matplotlib/status/1244178154618605568
- verify sourcing of content (especially on instagram & blog)
    - Instagram/blog: ensure mpl has right to repost/share content
    - make sure content is clearly cited
        - example: a tutorial using someone elseâ€™s example clearly cites the original source
- Limited self/corporate promotion is acceptable, but should be no more than about a quarter of the content of the blog/discourse post.
- if you think content is borderline, ask on the :ref:`_social-media-coordination` channels before publishing it
- acceptable image guide:
    - keep it geared towards science/data visualization, and non-controversial images
    - must be conform to the guidelines of all sites it may be posed on:
        - https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-rules
        - https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119

Accessibility
-------------
Images in communications should be as accessible as possible:

- add alt text to images and videos when the platform allows
    - https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/
    - https://medium.com/nightingale/writing-alt-text-for-data-visualization-2a218ef43f81
- warn on bright, strobing, images & turn off autoplay if possible
- for images made by the social media team:
  - make graphic perceivable to people who cannot perceive color well, due to color-blindness or low vision
  - do not make bright, strobing images

Social media account information
================================

Behavior
--------
When acting as a representative of the library, keep responses polite, and assume
user statements are in good faith unless they violate the [Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/conduct/)

Persona
-------
On social media, Matplotlib:

* Is a sentient visualization library, so talks about itself as a we, us, our, and it. Avoids talking about itself in the 3rd person.
* Is very earnest, eager to please, and aims to be patient & painfully oblivious to snark and sarcasm.
* Gets over-excited over shiny visualizations - lots of emojis and the like - and encourages folks to share their work.
* Highlights various parts of the library, especially the more obscure bits and bobbles.
* Acknowledges that it is a sometimes frustrating tangle of bits & bobbles that can confuse even the folks who work on it & signal boosts their confuzzlment.

Social graph
------------
- only follow organizations/projects - mostly NumFocus projects
    - especially 3rd party packages
    - should at least be visualization related
    - sponsors are also acceptable
- do not follow individual accounts for any reason (even maintainers/project leads/Guido!)

Recurrent social campaigns
--------------------------

- Release Announcements
    - Highlight new features & major deprecations
    - Link to download/install instructions
    - Ask folks to try it out.
- signal  boost third party packages
- GSOC work during GSOC recruiting and work times
- John Hunter Excellence in Plotting, submission and winners
